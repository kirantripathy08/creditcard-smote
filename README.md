Credit Card Fraud Detection using SMOTE analysis

Credit Card frauds are unique from a Machine Learning perspective. Since frauds are very rare as compared to legitimate transactions, any traditional ML model would show a high bias towards legitimate transactions.

SMOTE analysis helps by balancing the dataset, avoiding any biases irrespective of the dataset or model used.
